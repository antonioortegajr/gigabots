Curriculum for 4th/5th Graders

The current curriculum is designed to be 6 1-hour sessions with 4th and 5th grade students using Gigabots (https://github.com/TheGigabots).

Each of the six lessons has three main components:
** Google Slides which are meant for the presentation of the class
** A Walkthrough for a community volunteer or teacher to use for the class
** A Lesson Plan for teachers and administrators to know what is being covered in the lesson

The lessons break down as follows:

** Lesson 1: What is Coding? Students discuss the basics of what coding is.
